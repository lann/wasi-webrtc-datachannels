# Install the toolchain and dependencies needed to build, run, and test this
# repository. Safe to run repeatedly (idempotent) and shared by local developers, the
# CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml), and the Copilot cloud agent
# (.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml).
#
# What it installs:
#   - the pinned Rust toolchain and the wasm targets the guest components compile
#     to, as declared in rust-toolchain.toml:
#       * wasm32-unknown-unknown (echo-demo + the manual-signaling test guest)
#       * wasm32-wasip2          (cli-signaling)
#   - wasm-tools, used to wrap guest modules into components and to validate WIT
#   - just, the command runner used for development and CI recipes
#   - cargo-nextest, the faster test runner used by `just test`
#   - wac, the component linker used to compose the webrtc-consumer with the
#     wasip3 provider (`just compose-webrtc`)
#   - wasmtime, the host runtime that runs the composed in-guest WebRTC
#     integration test (`just test-webrtc-composed`)
#   - iproute2, nftables, and coturn, used by the conformance netns lab
#     (`just conformance-netns`; skip with SKIP_NETNS_LAB=1)
#   - the conformance Shadow lab (`just conformance-shadow`) needs the Shadow
#     network simulator, which this script does NOT install. Shadow ships no
#     upstream prebuilt binary and is slow to build, so it is built once by the
#     shadow-build workflow (scripts/build-shadow.sh) and published to the
#     `shadow-dev` GitHub prerelease; fetch it with scripts/download-shadow.sh or
#     build it locally with scripts/build-shadow.sh. The lab recipe prints this
#     guidance and fails if the binary is missing when it runs.
#   - the Node host's npm dependencies (jco + @roamhq/wrtc), and the conformance
#     jco adapter's npm dependencies (jco + @roamhq/wrtc + playwright-core)
#
# wasm-tools, just, and cargo-nextest are installed with cargo-binstall, which
# downloads the pinned prebuilt release binaries when available and automatically
# falls back to `cargo install` (compiling from source) otherwise. cargo-binstall
# itself is bootstrapped from its prebuilt release binary.
#
# Prerequisites (not installed here): a Rust toolchain via rustup, and Node 22+
# with npm. CI and copilot-setup-steps provision these before calling this
# script; local developers should install them first.
#
# Environment overrides:
#   WASM_TOOLS_VERSION   version of wasm-tools to install (default below)
#   JUST_VERSION         version of just to install (default below)
#   NEXTEST_VERSION      version of cargo-nextest to install (default below)
#   SKIP_NETNS_LAB=1       skip installing the conformance netns-lab tools (coturn…)
#   SKIP_NODE=1          skip installing the Node host's npm dependencies
