//! `webrtc-consumer`: a minimal consumer of the `lann:webrtc-datachannels`
//! `connections` interface, used to exercise (and integration-test) the
//! `wasip3-impl` provider component after composition with `wac plug`.
//!
//! It imports `peer-connection` and, on `wasi:cli/run`, stands up two peers
//! backed by the composed provider, exchanges their SDP + host candidates
//! directly (no external signaling), waits for both to connect, and exchanges
//! one message each way over a data channel — proving the whole in-guest WebRTC
//! stack works end to end through the exported interface.
//!
//! Build it as a `cdylib` for `wasm32-wasip2`; compose it against the provider:
//!
//! ```sh
//! wac plug webrtc_consumer.wasm --plug wasip3_webrtc_datachannels.wasm -o composed.wasm
//! wasmtime run -W component-model-async=y -S cli -S p3 -S inherit-network composed.wasm
//! ```
