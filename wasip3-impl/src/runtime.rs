//! The in-guest driver that runs a [`SansIoPeer`] over WASIp3 `wasi:sockets`
//! UDP and `wasi:clocks` timers.
//!
//! A [`Runtime`] owns one peer connection's socket and sans-I/O core. Because
//! the component-model async model is single-threaded and cooperative (no
//! cross-thread `spawn`), the event loop runs as a detached task started with
//! [`wit_bindgen::spawn_local`]: [`Runtime::pump`] repeatedly flushes queued
//! datagrams, drains the core's events into the shared queues that back the
//! exported resources, and parks on the earliest of a timer or an inbound
//! datagram. The exported `data-channel` / `peer-connection` methods observe
//! that shared state and wake the pump through [`futures`] channels.
